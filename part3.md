## Introduction to SQL üéâ

1. **What is SQL?**  
   SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It is used to communicate with databases.

   - DDL (Data Definition Language)  
   - DML (Data Manipulation Language)  
   - DQL (Data Query Language)  
   - DCL (Data Control Language)  
   - TCL (Transaction Control Language)

3. **Setting Up SQL Environment**  
   Install MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite to get started.
