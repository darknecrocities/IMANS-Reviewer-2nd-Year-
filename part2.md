## 🚀 Advanced Indexing Strategies

### Lesson 23: Clustered vs. Non-Clustered Indexes
- Understanding clustered and non-clustered indexes
- Benefits and use cases

**Example:**
```sql
-- Creating a clustered index
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX idx_student_id ON Students(StudentID);
```

### Lesson 24: Covering Indexes & Composite Indexes
- Indexing multiple columns for performance
- Avoiding table scans

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE INDEX idx_name_age ON Students(Name, Age);
```

### Lesson 25: Full-Text Search Indexing
- Using full-text search for large datasets

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE FULLTEXT INDEX ft_index ON Students(Name);
```

---

## 🔥 NoSQL & SQL Integration

### Lesson 26: Introduction to NoSQL
- Differences between SQL and NoSQL databases
- Use cases for each approach

### Lesson 27: Using JSON in SQL Databases
- Storing and querying JSON data

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT JSON_VALUE(data, '$.name') FROM Students WHERE StudentID = 1;
```

### Lesson 28: Hybrid Databases
- Combining SQL and NoSQL storage for flexibility

---

## ⚡ Performance Tuning & Query Optimization

### Lesson 29: Query Execution Plans
- Understanding and optimizing execution plans

**Example:**
```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM Students WHERE Age > 20;
```

### Lesson 30: Partitioning Strategies
- Horizontal and vertical partitioning for large datasets

**Example:**
```sql
ALTER TABLE Students PARTITION BY RANGE(Age) (
    PARTITION p1 VALUES LESS THAN (18),
    PARTITION p2 VALUES LESS THAN (30)
);
```

### Lesson 31: Caching Mechanisms
- Implementing caching to reduce load on the database

---

## 🏛 Data Warehousing

### Lesson 32: Introduction to Data Warehousing
- Concept of OLAP vs. OLTP

### Lesson 33: ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) Process
- Data extraction, transformation, and loading techniques

**Example:**
```sql
INSERT INTO DataWarehouse.Students SELECT * FROM SchoolDB.Students;
```

### Lesson 34: Star and Snowflake Schema
- Differences and implementation in SQL

---

## 🔄 Big Data Processing with SQL

### Lesson 35: SQL on Hadoop & Spark
- Using SQL with big data technologies

### Lesson 36: Streaming Data with SQL
- Real-time data processing with SQL

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT * FROM StreamingTable WHERE event_time > NOW() - INTERVAL 5 MINUTE;
```

---

## 📂 Real-World Applications & Case Studies

### Lesson 37: SQL in E-Commerce
- Managing product catalogs and orders

### Lesson 38: SQL in Finance
- Handling transactions and fraud detection

### Lesson 39: SQL in Healthcare
- Storing patient records securely

---

## 💡 Final Project: Advanced IMS

### Objective:
